You are a top-tier UI/UX designer + web strategist.
I want you to design the structure, layout, copywriting, and UX flow for a landing page for my agency EVERRON.

Context of the Business

EVERRON is an AI Automation Agency.
We offer multiple automations, but the landing page must highlight ONE core flagship service:

⭐ MAIN VALUE PROPOSITION

24/7 automated replies for businesses, especially on WhatsApp.

This is our hero offer — the service that positions EVERRON as essential and high-impact.

We also offer automation across:

Instagram

Facebook

Email

Website chat


…but WhatsApp automation should remain the main headline and main driver of conversions.

Design Requirements

Visual style must be clean, modern, minimal, premium (Linear, Vercel, Notion vibes).

Avoid all cliché AI branding styles (neon, gradients, fly-in robot illustrations).

Focus on modern CSS + current UI/UX patterns.

Navigation should be minimal: 2–3 tabs maximum.

The brand EVERRON should feel confident, reliable, and modern.
